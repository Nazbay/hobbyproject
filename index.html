              Also known as devzira plov, this local dish exudes unimaginable
              flavours. There are several versions of plov cooking across
              Central Asia, but the Osh plov uses a unique combination of
              ingredients and seasonings. Red rice (devzira) is cooked to
              perfection over low heat, along with vegetables (yellow carrots
              and onions), tender meat and a special bouquet of spices. Served
              with Shakarap salad, a fairly simple tomato and onion salad, the
              Osh plov is a Central Asian culinary quintessence.

              Maida manty is a delicious dish in the form of small dumplings
              that you will find only in the Osh region. Despite similarities
              with its older culinary sibling, the manty dish, which is very
              popular throughout Kyrgyzstan, maida manty are small, exquisitely
              handmade dumplings with mashed potatoes, steamed with a perfect
              fine texture of dough. Order a small plate as an appetiser or a
              big plate to share with friends. The dish is often served with
              spicy red onion and sour cream.Traditional Kyrgyz manty is usually
              a meat dish, but maidy manty is traditionally made without animal
              products (dairy products, eggs or animal fat), so it is an ideal
              dish for vegetarians and vegans. Another dish suitable for
              vegetarians is kok chuchwara, which are small dumplings stuffed
              with jusai, a local herb that resembles spinach.

              Osh has long prided itself on turning even the most traditional

              dish known in the city as Chon Samsa), which can be bought at
              various points in the city. Even the smaller sized samsa, known as
              Parmuda Samsa, is also big in size and hearty. Irrespective of
              size, samsa is a puff pastry baked in a tandoor oven and stuffed
              with meat and onions. Osh samsas, known as Osh samsas, are samosas
              slow-cooked on the walls of a tandyr oven. Some are sprinkled with
              sesame seeds, to note that such samsas have chilli pepper added
              for extra flavour. As a rule, samsas are cooked with lamb, but
              there are some in which potatoes are added, which only adds extra
              flavour and aroma. Samsa is a great dish for a hearty snack, if
              you eat it hot and freshly baked in a tandoor oven. You can also
              stock up on samosas if you go camping, in which case, rest
              assured, you will not go hungry when you go camping.

              cooked to perfection, usually with fresh onions and vinegar. Even

              best of Central Asian cuisine. The different ethnic groups in the
              region have brought something unique to the dish, which is why it
              is a dish worth trying again and again. In addition to the variety
              of herbs used in the dish and added to the meat, this crown dish
              of the region can be served with differently cooked noodles -
              fried, boiled or as a noodle soup. There is another dish, ganfan,
              which has similar basic ingredients but is served with rice
              instead of noodles. And if you want a little spice in your meal,
              ask for a delightful spice, laza, which is a seasoning of red
              pepper, garlic and oil.

            According to locals, koumiss also has properties that aid in better

            koumiss the first time.

          It was one of the religious Muslim centres of Central Asia. It is best

          Sulaiman-Too mountain (Sulaiman-Takhty, Solomon's Throne), which is
          one of the pilgrimage sites of Central Asian Muslims.Suleiman Mountain
          also has seven caves with their own names: Chakatamar from the word
          'chakka' which means 'to drip', from the ceiling of which, water,
          considered to be healing, constantly drips; Tepeunkur 'cave on top' -
          a cave which has an almost vertical descent; Chilten Khana or Teshik
          Tash 'hole stone' which has three entrances; Ishen-Unkur cave, which

        <p>
          Sary-Chelek, translated from Kyrgyz as "yellow bowl", is a freshwater
          lake in Kyrgyzstan. It is located on the territory of the Sary-Chelek
          State Biosphere Reserve, near the junction of Chatkal Ridge and
          At-Oinok Ridge, in the Western Tien Shan. The lake was formed about 10
          thousand years ago as a result of a rock slide. 7.5 km in length from
          north-east to south-west, the area is 507 ha. The lake is situated 500
          km from Bishkek on the territory of the Sary-Chelek reserve. The
          deepest mark of the lake is 234 m. It is the third deepest lake in
          Central Asia and the second deepest in Kyrgyzstan. The shoreline is
          highly indented and lined with dense forests that sink into the depths
          of the lake. There are shallow sections of the lake only in the larger
          of the bays. The lake is fed by numerous streams, underground streams
          and the waters of the Sary-Chelek River. The lake is drained by the
          Tuskual River. There are many disputes about the formation of the
          lake. Some scientists think that the lake was formed due to the
          collision of two mountain ridges that blocked the river, others think
          that the lake was formed as a result of a change in the fault line
          about 2000 years ago. The lake's water is often blue with a greenish
          tint, which makes the lake very beautiful.

          there, except perhaps tourist gas cookers. But it is here that you can
          buy Uzgen rice, which is said to be the best for making pilaw. Besides
          rice, here you can buy millet, beans, peas, buckwheat and many other
          groats and seeds. What kind of food is prepared in the Orient without
          spices? You'll find a great variety of aromatic spices in the bazaar
          and they are meant to make the food even tastier. You can't miss the
          poppy seed and sesame seed cakes baked on the spot. Kurut, a dried,
          heavily salted ayran, is especially popular. It is transported around
          the market on carts. It is said to quench one's thirst. Peanuts are
          sold in large, canvas sacks. You can also buy live poultry and try on
          the national headdress next to it. You can buy melons and watermelons

          classical route to the peak has no steep rock or ice sections, in some
          parts the slopes are 45-55º steep, there are frequent avalanches and
          ice cavings. In spite of the technical simplicity of the classical
          route, the ascent to Lenin Peak is classified as high-altitude
          mountaineering and requires from the climbers robust physical and
          mental health, suitable equipment and a sensible approach to
          acclimatisation. Experience of climbing at least 5,000m above sea
          level is required.
